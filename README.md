# Movie-Recommendation
Movie Recommendation System Using Python

- Recommender systems can be understood as systems that make suggestions. We often ask our friends about their views on recently watched movies. Based on that, we decide whether to watch the movie or drop the idea altogether.
- That is what Recommender systems usually do. They help us make a selection, narrow down our search, and enjoy the selected list of movies without wasting time searching for which movie to watch.
- Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways â€“ either by Collaborative or Content-based filtering. These approaches are often combined in Hybrid Recommender Systems.
